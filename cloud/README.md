# cloud

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_CN.md)

`cloud` is go-spring's library of distributed-application building blocks —
service discovery, load balancing, distributed locking, governance, caching,
messaging, scheduling, security, ... Every package is a small, explicit
contract around one question ("which instances exist right now?", "may this
replica run this job?"), usable with nothing but a `context.Context` — no IoC
container required. Container wiring for each family lives in the
`starter-*` modules, not here.

## The packages

| Package | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| [actuator](actuator/) | Management endpoints: probe paths ([endpoint](actuator/endpoint/)), component health checks ([health](actuator/health/)), Kubernetes Pod metadata ([podinfo](actuator/podinfo/)). |
| [cache](cache/) | A cache API declared once (`spring.cache`) and backed by go-redis / redigo / bigcache / memcached via starters. |
| [discovery](discovery/) | "Which live `host:port` addresses serve this logical name right now?" — the read side of a naming service, adapted once per backend. |
| [governance](governance/) | Runtime service governance: a centralized, hot-reloadable policy center fanning out to [resilience](governance/resilience/) (circuit breaking / rate limiting / retry), [fault](governance/fault/) (fault injection) and [traffic](governance/traffic/) (load-test traffic identification). |
| [loadbalance](loadbalance/) | "Given the live instance set, which one gets this request?" — client-side balancing with failure-based suspension. |
| [lock](lock/) | "May this replica run this exclusive work right now?" — distributed locking and leader election behind one contract. |
| [mesh](mesh/) | "Am I behind a service-mesh sidecar?" — when yes, the app's own discovery/load-balancing steps aside. |
| [messaging](messaging/) | Publish/consume `Message` envelopes through one `Publisher`/`Subscriber` pair; switching brokers is a wiring change. |
| [observability](observability/) | Per-request attributes carried on the context, so spans started on your behalf carry them too. |
| [scheduling](scheduling/) | Periodic and cron-scheduled background jobs: triggers (`FixedRate`, `FixedDelay`, `After`, cron, `DailyWindow`), concurrency policies, distributed-lock de-duplication. |
| [security](security/) | Framework-agnostic authentication and authorization — identity model plus per-family middleware shells. |
| [experimental](experimental/) | Evolving additions, not yet committed to the stable surface: [batch](experimental/batch/), [contract](experimental/contract/) testing, [loadtest](experimental/loadtest/), [outbox](experimental/outbox/), [session](experimental/session/), [transaction](experimental/transaction/). |

Each package has its own `README.md` (and Chinese `README_CN.md`) with the
design rationale and usage; families that carry per-module design rules also
keep a `DESIGN.md`.

## How it fits with the rest

The packages here are plain Go libraries: construct them directly, or let the
matching `starter-*` module register them from configuration. Backends
(Redis, etcd, Nacos, ...) are never imported here — each package defines the
contract, the corresponding starter supplies the SDK-backed implementation.
