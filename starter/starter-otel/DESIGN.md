# starter-otel Design

[English](DESIGN.md) | [中文](DESIGN_CN.md)

`starter-otel` is a Global/infrastructure-archetype starter
(`starter/DESIGN.md` §2.4). It builds the process-wide OpenTelemetry
`TracerProvider` / `MeterProvider` from `${spring.observability}` and
installs them as OTel globals so any instrumented component (starter-
gorm-*, starter-mesh, http/gRPC middlewares, ...) is wired without
per-component adaptation.

## 1. Responsibilities & Boundaries

- Owns the shared trace + metrics providers, propagator, and resource
  attributes. It does not install a log-trace correlation hook: the
  `log.FieldsFromContext` seam is a single process-wide point, too narrow to
  ship one opinionated installer, so the app owns it (see the example).
- Wiring model is **implicit-global**, not per-bean: importing the
  starter is the opt-in; every OTel-aware library reads the globals.
- Exports the providers as beans **only** for shutdown ordering. Callers
  do not autowire them.
- Optionally contributes a Prometheus `/metrics` handler as an
  `endpoint.Endpoint`, so `starter-actuator` — if present — serves it on
  the shared management port without any cross-starter import.

## 2. Key Abstractions & Seams

- **Eager provider construction in `gs.Module`.** The module body runs
  during `applyModules` (RefreshPrepare), i.e. before any bean's
  constructor. Setting `otel.SetTracerProvider` / `SetMeterProvider`
  here guarantees a downstream `db.Use` / `otelhttp.NewHandler` observes
  live providers. Constructing lazily in a bean would break ordering.
- **Endpoint contribution seam.** With a pull (Prometheus) exporter and
  `metrics.port=0`, the starter exposes the scrape handler as an
  `endpoint.Endpoint` bean. `starter-actuator` collects every
  `endpoint.Endpoint` and mounts them on `:9370` — one scrape port for
  operators. With `metrics.port>0` a dedicated `http.Server` is used.
- **`log.FieldsFromContext` seam (not installed by the starter).** The seam
  is a single process-wide hook that stamps every record with the active
  span's `trace_id`/`span_id`. Only one installer wins by design, and the
  range of correlation strategies apps may want is too wide for the starter
  to pick one, so it leaves the seam to the application. The example installs
  the canonical hook itself.
- **Runtime metrics as an opt-in extra.** `runtime` instrumentation is
  registered against the same MeterProvider so `mp.Shutdown` tears it
  down — no separate stop hook to manage.
- **Enable=false is a full no-op.** Left as SDK no-op providers; an
  imported-but-disabled starter has no runtime effect.

## 3. Constraints

- **One TracerProvider and one MeterProvider per process.** Globals are
  singletons; a second `starter-otel`-like installer would race.
- **Exporter `none` disables the pillar.** Same effect as `enable:
  false` but per-pillar (e.g. traces on, metrics off).
- **Prometheus exporter is pull-based.** Choose port=0 (mount via
  actuator) or port>0 (dedicated server). Both cannot be used.
- **Shutdown order matters.** Providers are registered as beans with
  `Destroy` hooks so pending spans/metrics flush before other beans
  (which may still emit) tear down.

## 4. Trade-offs / Alternatives Rejected

- **Per-component bean injection of a tracer — rejected.** Making every
  component depend on a `trace.Tracer` bean forces cross-starter imports
  and defeats the OTel global model. The point of an ecosystem-standard
  API is that libraries read globals.
- **Bundling exporters/pillars into their own starters — rejected.**
  Splitting would duplicate resource assembly and force operators to
  synchronise many enable flags. One starter, one config tree.
